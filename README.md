## My process
- I wrote the HTML codes first then added the styling to the page
- I worked on the image first, the width and height and also justified it to the center of the page
- Then I worked on creating the container around the images and texts
- Then finally, I adjusted the font sizes, widthm height and padding of the texts


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox


### What I learned
I learnt to adjust contents to the center of the screen, I had to create divs for them first

I'm most proud of this code snippet because I thought I had forgotten how to use box shadows but when I started coding, I got the inspiration instantly
```css
.main-body{
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 4%;
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgb(200, 202, 204), 
                0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
}

I'm also porud of the fact that I had to figure out how to make the code work all by myself without any external help


### Continued development
I'd like to learn more on responsiveness, and how to efficiently use flexbox and CSS properties in general
